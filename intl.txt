Do you know the `Intl` object in Javascript?

This namespace stands for the ECMAScript's internationalization API, and
provides some nice features such as string comparison, and number, date and time
formatting. With this post I'll show about currency formatting using the
`NumberFormat` constructor.

Recently I had to format integers to a currency format and I had 2 options:
- Do it myself (which I'm a huge fan of)
- Use some external library

But this time was different, and I took some time to search about the topic and
then I found `Intl.NumberFormat`. It's usage is simple, here's an example:

```js
const reaisFormatter = new Intl.NumberFormat('pt-BR', {
  style: 'currency',
  currency: 'BRL'
})

reaisFormatter.format(123.50) // R$ 123,50
```

And that was it. Simple, huh? And within the `NumberFormat` constructor you have
an infinity of possibilities, such as unit formatting (liters, centimeters,
foot...), percentage, decimal formatting and so on.

Perheps you don't need to `npm install` something to do that anymore. Hope you
enjoyed it!

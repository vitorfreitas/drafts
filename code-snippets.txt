What do you know about code snippets?

Snippets are a awesome tool that most editors have. With this feature you can
magically write a great amount of boilerplate code with a small set of
characters.

Eg: "log" to write console.log(), "warn" to write console.warn(), and more
complex ones such as creating the whole boilerplate of a React component with
"rcomp".

Here are some snippets of my own:

As the book "The pragmatic programmer" says: "Tools amplify your talent. The
better your tools, and the better you know how to use them, the more productive
you can be.". I personally think that we as programmers MUST use the better
tools for our job, and know how to use those tools well, and code snippets is
one of those tools that can make you more productive, so as your code editor and
so on.

I use Vim for code editting and it has a great plugin for write your own
snippets called UltiSnips (https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips), but for sure
you code editor will have plugins or native support for this feature.
